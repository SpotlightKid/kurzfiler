<h1>KurzFiler</h1>

<h3>Tour 2: VeloSplit Keymaps</h3>

<p>Do you sometimes use AKAI-CDs on your Kurz? Well - it's a little bit 
of work to get a nice program from an imported CD. Here's how you can do
it easier:</p>

<p>That's what you get when you load a volume of an AKAI-CD into the Kurz, 
save it to disk and load the file into KurzFiler:<br>

<p>Goal of this example is to get a single layer velocity split program of 
the Suitcase Rhodes. So at first, delete all other programs and keymaps. 
Here's the result:<br>

<p>I don't like the '-1' in the names, so let's kill them. You can double 
click into the name fields an edit them right in place<br>

<p>Now let's build the velosplit keymap. All you have to do is select all
the keymaps you want to use and click on 'New Keymap'. This is the window
you get as a result:<br>
<img width=400 height=300 src=ke04.jpg></p>

<p>For each of the eight velocity levels that are used in keymaps (ppp to 
fff) you can select which keymap shall be used. The 'Level 0 ppp to fff' 
means that the original keymap (i.e. '200 SCASE MEDIUM') only has one level
which handles all strikes from ppp to fff.<br>
Here's how I have sorted the keymaps: the harder I press a key, the 'harder'
the sound.<br>

<p>After pressing 'OK', you can select a name for the new keymap and one
for the simple program that uses it.<br>

<p>Here's the new objects. Look at keymap #204: it has 4 velocity levels and
it is quite big (1584 Bytes). The new program is a really simple one. You can use
it, but at least the AMPENV and VelTrk on the AMP-Page should be set to 
piano-like values (the sound should get louder when you press harder, and it 
should decay).<br>

<p>Click on 'File/File Information' gives you this:<br>
<img width=251 height=155 src=ke08.jpg></p>

<p>In order to make the file smaller and nicer, you can use the compact feature:
select the keymap that links to all samples, then click on 'Compact Keymap'. Here's
the result:<br>
<img width=700 height=500 src=ke09.jpg></p>

<p>All 100 have been packed into the new sample 'Suitcase Rhodes'. The keymaps have
become smaller, too. Here's what 'File Information' says:<br>

<p>That's all! Save it by clicking on the diskette symbol and load it right into 
your K.</p>
